This is a MUST!!!! But be forewarned. You shouldn’t do it if you have back problems or can’t walk up hills. But if you can it’s seriously one of the best times!!! Jumping off 27 foot cliffs and God made water slides. I was there 3 weeks ago and just finally been able to sit on a regular chair. But I would do it again in a heartbeat!!! Francisco was our guide and he ruled!!!!! Don’t miss this!!!!
